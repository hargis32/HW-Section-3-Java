# HW-Section-3-JavaScript

**Description**

This password generator was created as a practice for beginner Javascript techniques. It is intended to ask you for a password length of 8-128 characters, then as you to confirm or deny the usage of Uppercase, Lowercase, Numeric, and Special characters. It should return an error message if any of these criteria are improperly responded to. It will then generate a random password containing the selected criteria.
